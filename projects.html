    <h1>Online Store</h1>
    <img src="store.jpg" alt="online-store" width="1500" height="750"><br><br>
    <p> I develop this online store for an assignment in school, showcasing my skills in Html and CSS. The idea is inspired from website like canada computers and I attempted to code and design the webpage using what I have learned from school. Id say it turned out really good but I know there is always room for improvement.</p><br><br><br>

    <p> This is an Online cleaning business job posting. I develeoped this website using my own ideas and the things I have learned from school. It's not perfect but the idea is, that if I can design and make a webpage from inspiration from other active website, I think that maybe I can create one using my own ideas, using my own designs. I've continued to develop this website and actually have an active link waiting just in case I needed to use it.<br>HERE IS AN ACTIVE LINK TO THIS WEBSITE:</p><br><br><br>

    <img src="flight3.jpg" alt="flight-management" width="500" height="500"><br><br>
    <p>This is a flight management website developed purely out of Object oriendted programming. The idea is for it to function like an actual flight booking software or website that an employee can add passenger, book passenger, view passengers, view flights etc. I am very proud of how this website came out as it shows my progression in learning programming. It's not a one overnight thing that I can learn, but everyday I am striving to become better at it. </p>
